Their Michigan social circles led them to meet! While their connection \n\t\t\t\twas friendly, they lost touch shortly afterward.\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"web-image\" src='assets/telluride.JPG'/>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t<section class=\"even\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"web-image\" src='assets/buena-vista.jpg'/>\n\t\t\t\tAfter undergrad, Sierra moved to Denver for graduate school. \n\t\t\t\tShe has always loved to ski and with her brother also living in Denver, she quickly felt right at home. \n\t\t\t\tThat feeling led her to stay put while starting her career as an early childhood social worker.\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tA couple of years later, Carlâ€™s software engineering job had gone remote. \n\t\t\t\tBeing able to work from anywhere, he felt an itch to try something new. \n\t\t\t\tHe called up a college buddy to ask if he could crash at his place in Denver for a couple of weeks. \n\t\t\t\tNot long after, he started researching apartments.\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t<section>\n\t\t\tShortly after moving into his own place, Carl conveniently set his dating app filter to a one-mile radius, \n\t\t\tand luck would have it Sierra popped up. The surprise of seeing familiar faces excited the two so \n\t\t\tthey planned a date to get drinks. While the margaritas were heavily watered down, the conversation was not.\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\tCarl + Sierra spent the next couple of years doing everything with each other, and it became clear that \n\t\t\tthey were meant to be. Soon enough, they started house hunting and landed in a nice townhome near downtown Denver.\n\t\t\t<img class=\"web-image\" src='assets/paris.jpg'/>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t<section class=\"even\">\n\t\t\t<img class=\"web-image\" src='assets/engagement.jpg'/>\n\t\t\tIn June of 2024, after living in their new home for about a half year, they were slowly making \n\t\t\tit their own.
