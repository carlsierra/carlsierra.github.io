                    Our wedding will be an adult-only party (with the exception of our nieces and nephews). 
                    Please only RSVP for those who are addressed on your invitation to the wedding and reception. 
                    We hope you understand and that you can still make it! Reach out if you will be in need of care for your children in Denver. 
                    However, please feel free to bring your children to the welcome party to celebrate with us.

                    <li><h4>What is the best way to get to the wedding events?</h4>
                    We encourage you to stay at our hotel room blocks for easy transportation during the weekend! A shuttle will be provided from The Limelight Hotel to/from Moss. Everything else is walkable! If you choose to drive, a complimentary parking lot is available at Moss starting at 5pm, as well as street parking. Please arrive no later than 5:15pm!
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>Will your wedding events be indoors or outdoors?</h4>
                    All of our wedding events will have an indoor option at all times! There are places to get some fresh air on a patio but a majority of the events will take place indoors.
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>Is there a dress code for the wedding?</h4>
                    The dress code for our wedding is cocktail attire. We suggest that men wear a suit or sport coat with a tie and women wear a midi- or knee-length dress or dressy separates.
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>Is there a dress code for the welcome party?</h4>
                    No, please dress casual and join us for some food and drinks!
                    </li>

                    <li><h4>How do I RSVP?</h4>
                    When our invitations are sent, you will then be able to access our RSVP page through our wedding website to let us know if you will be attending any of our wedding events (fingers crossed you will!)
