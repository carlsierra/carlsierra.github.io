				Carl + Sierra both come from Michigan, although on opposite sides of the state; 
				Carl grew up in the Detroit suburbs, while Sierra was raised in the beach town of Grand Haven. 
				<br/><br/>
				When Carl moved to Chicago after college, their paths decided to cross for the first time. 
				Sierra had still been living in Michigan at the time, but would occasionally come into town 
				to visit friends. Their Michigan social circles led them to meet! While their connection 
				was friendly, they lost touch shortly afterward.

				After undergrad, Sierra moved to Denver for graduate school. 
				She has always loved to ski and with her brother also living in Denver, she quickly felt right at home. 
				That feeling led her to stay put while starting her career as an early childhood social worker.
				<br/><br/>
				A couple of years later, Carlâ€™s software engineering job had gone remote. 
				Being able to work from anywhere, he felt an itch to try something new. 
				He called up a college buddy to ask if he could crash at his place in Denver for a couple of weeks. 
				Not long after, he started researching apartments.

			Shortly after moving into his own place, Carl conveniently set his dating app filter to a one-mile radius, 
			and luck would have it Sierra popped up. The surprise of seeing familiar faces excited the two so 
			they planned a date to get drinks. While the margaritas were heavily watered down, the conversation was not.
			<br/><br/>
			Carl + Sierra spent the next couple of years doing everything with each other, and it became clear that 
			they were meant to be. Soon enough, they started house hunting and landed in a nice townhome near downtown Denver.

			In June of 2024, after living in their new home for about a half year, they were slowly making 
			it their own. Sierra planned a date night of ordering pizza, drinking wine, and learning how to 
			paint a bathroom - it sounded wonderful. 
			<br/><br/>
			Little did she know, Carl had also been planning something wonderful. 
			Once they finished painting, Carl got on one knee to ask her to marry him, and she said yes! 
			It was a perfect, intimate, and spontaneous proposal.

			Today, you can find the engaged couple biking around Denver, planning a weekend to the mountains, enjoying a 
			jazz club, or cooking delicious food at home. They are extremely happy to be getting married and 
			hope their closest friends and family can join them!
