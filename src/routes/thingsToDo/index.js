			<h2>Things to do</h2>
			<p>All of these favs are within walking distance of our suggested hotels!</p>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Drinks | dinner at Sunday vinyl</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>We recently stumbled upon this place + got fantastic cocktails! They only play vinyl records here which is a nice throwback.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Breakfast at Onefold</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Local breakfast option, this highly-rated place is one of our favorites. It’s an asian | mexican take on morning eats. Carl loves the breakfast burrito and Sierra always gets the bacon fried-rice.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Breakfast at Snooze</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Also local to Denver, this chain is the most popular breakfast in town. The eggs benedict are luscious.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Walk to Commons park | confluence park</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Short walk from hotels, these are great city parks connected to each other. Lots of cool bridges with good views of rivers - ie the “confluence” of cherry creek and platte river. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Platte street</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Walk a bit further from commons park up to Platte street to explore more - we like Denver Poke Company, Denver Beer Co, Room for Milly, Brider + Daughter Thai here! Walk even further, further, and you’ll find yourself in the highlands, the neighborhood where Carl + Sierra used to live.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>Walk | run | bike cherry creek trail</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Head due southwest from Union Station and you’ll run into Cherry Creek trail - this is a gigantic 45-mile trail that cuts through Denver. Carl and Sierra like to bike on this trail to get from one end of Denver to the other, but you’ll find people walking and exercising, too.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class='thing-title'>coffee | cocktails at Hello darling</p>
				<p class='thing-description'>Take a little stroll across the Denver Millennium Bridge for a great view of Commons Park and end up at Hello Darling for coffee, cocktails, or a glass of wine.</p>
			</div>
